Disclaimer: I strongly suggest not using these scripts outside of exactly as stated in the SOP DNA_SCIDNGS_3.

While these scripts are tested for the specific use stated in the SOP, using them for other purposes should be done only if you are comfortable modifying shell scripts and troubleshooting any issues.
These scripts: might have hard coding that is specific to my system, might contain errors, might not follow current best practices, might inadvertently delete or alter your source files.
